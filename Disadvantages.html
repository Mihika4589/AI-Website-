<h2><p style="background-color:rgb(79, 238, 124);color:rgb(248, 157, 47);">What are the Disadvantages for AI?</p></h2>
<h3><p>1. Machines Cannot Feel Compassion And Sympathy.</p></h3>
<h3><p>There is no doubt that machines are much better when it comes to working efficiency but they cannot replace the human connection that makes the team. 
Machines cannot develop a bond with humans.</p></h3>
<h3><p>2. Increase In Unemployment And Job Security Issues</p></h3>
<h3><p>With more and more machines being designed, there will be an abrupt increase in unemployment and job security. 
Since machines are replacing human resources, the rate of people losing their jobs will increase.
Needless to say, humans will be no longer a priority for companies.
The only way to empower yourself in the IT industry is by improving your technical skills and by finding trends for future jobs requirement.
If you are a programmer, you should always keep analyzing the programming job requirement in the future.</p></h3>
<h3><p>3. Risk Of Loss Of Important Data</p></h3>
<h3><p>Living in the 21st century, we've seen and even experienced it once or more than once in our lives that our important information gets missing due to technical issues such as machine damage or the software of our system getting corrupt.
We use computers, smartphones and other devices to store almost all our important documents, files, pictures, and videos.
Once lost, it is not possible (or very difficult) to retrieve this information.
This can cause serious trouble for your business.</p></h3>
<h3><p>4. The exploitation of artificial intelligence</p></h3>
<h3><p>Misuse or exploitation of anything is bad.
In the case of artificial intelligence, it's worse.
We often hear threats that the misuse of technology can bring the world to a destructive end. 
This stands true to a great extent as we have seen in animated movies and films.</p></h3>
