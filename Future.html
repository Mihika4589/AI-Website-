<h2><p style="background-color:rgb(111, 253, 173);color:white"><u>What would our future be life if there was no AI in the world?</u></p></h2>
<h3><p style="color:rgb(13, 222, 156)">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. 
AI is already being used in many industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, to name a few.
It has the ability to automate tasks that were once done by humans, making them faster and more efficient. 
However, there are some skills that cannot be replicated by AI, such as creativity, management, and hospitality.
If there was no AI in the world, we would still be able to function as a society. 
However, we would not have access to the many benefits that AI provides. 
For example, we would not have self-driving cars or virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa. 
We would also not have access to the vast amounts of data that AI can process and analyze.
In conclusion, while we could still function without AI, our lives would be very different. 
AI has the potential to make our lives easier and more efficient in many ways. 
However, it is important to remember that there are some skills that cannot be replicated by AI and that human creativity and ingenuity will always be important.</p></h3>

<h2><p style="background-color:rgb(119, 121, 250);color:white"><u>In the future, if AI was more dominant in the world how would it look like?</u></p></h2>
<h3><p style="color:rgb(18, 151, 233)">The future of AI is a key transformation factor for many industries and organizations. 
AI systems rely on four main components: computing power, data, algorithms, and tools.
All of these components have the potential for dramatic improvements in the near future, though the exact timeline is uncertain.
AI is no longer a curiosity, but a necessity for staying competitive and innovative.
AI has already started to change the world in many ways. 
For example, it has been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech. 
AI has also been used to create generative art and to help with visual effects in movies. 
In the future, AI could be used to help solve some of the world's biggest problems such as climate change, disease, and poverty. 
It could also be used to create new jobs and industries that we haven't even thought of yet.
However, there are also concerns about the future of AI. 
For example, some people are worried that AI could take over jobs that are currently done by humans. 
Others are concerned about the ethics of generative AI. 
Despite these concerns, it seems clear that AI will continue to play an important role in our lives in the future.</p></h3>
