    <h3><p style="background-color:rgb(255, 254, 254);color:rgb(252, 159, 125)">AI is currently being applied to a range of functions both in the lab and in commercial/consumer settings: Allows intelligent systems to convert human speech into text or code. 
A subset of speech recognition, enables conversational interaction between humans and computers.</p></h3>

<h3><p style="background-color:rgb(255, 249, 249);color:rgb(139, 158, 255)">There are numerous success stories that prove AI's value. 
Organizations that add machine learning and cognitive interactions to traditional business processes and applications can greatly improve user experience and boost productivity.
However, there are some stumbling blocks. 
Few companies have deployed AI at scale, for several reasons. 
For example, if they don't use cloud computing, machine learning projects are often computationally expensive. 
They're also complex to build and require expertise that's in high demand but short supply. 
Knowing when and where to incorporate these projects, as well as when to turn to a third party, will help minimize these difficulties.</p></h3>
